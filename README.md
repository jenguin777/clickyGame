# clickyGame

* a memory game created with React. This application renders different images to the screen. Each image listens for click events.
The application keeps track of the user's score. 

* The user's score is incremented when clicking an image for the first time. The user's score resets to 0 if they click the same image more than once.

* Every time an image is clicked, the images rendered to the page are shuffled in a random order.

* Once the user's score is reset after an incorrect guess, the game restarts.
